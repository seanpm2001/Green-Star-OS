as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/Green-Star-OS-dev/Green-Star-OS/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# Green-Star-OS
A research project into North Koreas Red Star OS, and a set of themes for making a Red Star OS clone.

***

## About

![/Graphics/Flag/SVG/Flag_of_North_Korea.svg](/Graphics/Flag/SVG/Flag_of_North_Korea.svg)

See above. This project is a research project into North Korean technology, especially Red Star OS, along with themes and scripts designed to ease the creation of a Red Star OS desktop without having to use the actual operating system or its malware.

This project is written in Lua and MoonScript. It is highly incomplete, and very early in development.

The name `Green Star` is in reference to `Red Star` it indicates that this project is not a Communist project, but a more liberal/Socialist one. The reason MoonScript is used is because I also wanted to make this the moon that covers the evil Red Star, and because Lua was a good language for programming this project in.

### Archive.org downloads

#### Red Star OS

**⚠️ WARNING:** Be extremely careful with these and NEVER install them on your main computer (virtual machine only) the third listed link is reported to be able to escape virtual machines, so it should only be installed on an extra computer that you are willing to wipe and reinstall. This is a North Korean operating system. The default language is Korean, but English modifications exist online. DO NOT INSTALL THIS ON YOUR MAIN COMPUTER! Also, please make sure none of your devices are connected to the Internet before installing.

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
