Sogwang Office is the default Office Software in Red Star OS. It appeared in Red Star OS 3, but may have been there in older versions. Sogwang office is a heavily modified version of OpenOffice, and is named after the Sogwansa Buddhist Temple in Kosan Country, Kangwon Province, in North Korea. This temple was destroyed by United States bombing during the Korean War in 1951, and is a prominent site to North Korea, which intends to rebuild it, but doesn't appear to have made any progress in the past 71 years.
