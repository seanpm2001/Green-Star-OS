##### No Motherland without you

"No Motherland Without You" (or "Ode to Kim Jong Il"), is a North Korean song about the country's Eternal Leader, Kim Jong Il. Composed by Hwang Jin Yong and written by Ri Jong O, it extols the proclaimed talent and virtues of Kim, and the attachment of the North Korean people for him as he led them out of the turmoils of the 1990s famine (referred to as the Arduous March).

The repeated phrase in the song is "We cannot live without you! Our country cannot exist without you!" It is also considered to be the anthem of the Songun ("military-first") policy that Kim implemented in coexistence with the Juche Idea in 1995. It is frequently broadcast on the radio and from loudspeakers on the streets of Pyongyang.
