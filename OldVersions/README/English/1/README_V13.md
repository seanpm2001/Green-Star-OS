Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/Green-Star-OS-dev/Green-Star-OS/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# Green-Star-OS
A research project into North Koreas Red Star OS, and a set of themes for making a Red Star OS clone.

***

## About

![/Graphics/Flag/SVG/Flag_of_North_Korea.svg](/Graphics/Flag/SVG/Flag_of_North_Korea.svg)

**Note:** Green Star OS is **NOT** an Operating System

See above. This project is a research project into North Korean technology, especially Red Star OS, along with themes and scripts designed to ease the creation of a Red Star OS desktop without having to use the actual operating system or its malware.

This project is written in Lua and MoonScript. It is highly incomplete, and very early in development.

The name `Green Star` is in reference to `Red Star` it indicates that this project is not a Communist project, but a more liberal/Socialist one. The reason MoonScript is used is because I also wanted to make this the moon that covers the evil Red Star, and because Lua was a good language for programming this project in.

###### Red Star OS

###### Red Star OS 1

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse this preview picture</p></summary>

![/Graphics/Red_Star_OS/Logo/2020/SVG/Red_Star_OS_Logo_2020.svg](/Graphics/Red_Star_OS/Logo/2020/SVG/Red_Star_OS_Logo_2020.svg)

</details>

Red Star OS 1 is North Koreas first custom operating system. Before this, North Korea used Windows XP and other Windows operating systems. They made a Linux distribution called Red Star OS to fit their needs, as they couldn't retain the rights to Windows and noted it to be insecure and dangerous (they are right on this, but the operating system they made is even more dangerous) Red Star OS 1 is based on Fedora Linux 11. It has a Windows XP-like interface.

No further information is currently known.

###### Red Star OS 2

![/Graphics/Red_Star_OS/2.0/PNG/Windowing_in_Red_Star_Linux.png](/Graphics/Red_Star_OS/2.0/PNG/Windowing_in_Red_Star_Linux.png)

</details>

Red Star OS 2 is the second version of North Koreas Red Star OS operating system. It has a similar look to GNOME 1.0, but as like Red Star OS 1, most of the GNU/Linux symbols are replaced with North Korean Communist ones (most notably the Red Star)

No further information is currently known.

###### Red Star OS 3

<details open><summary><p lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse this preview picture</p></summary>

![/Graphics/Red_Star_OS/3.0/Desktop/PNG/RedStarOS-2021-04-03-16-50-57.png](/Graphics/Red_Star_OS/3.0/Desktop/PNG/RedStarOS-2021-04-03-16-50-57.png)

</details>

Red Star OS 3 is the third installment to North Koreas Red Star OS Linux distribution. It has a similar look to early Mac OS X (Pre-OS-X) this design was probably inspired by an iMac that Kim Jong Un was seen with in 2013. Although the system heavily resembles MacOS, it is to be noted that it is not based on MacOS, although some of the methods Apple used are in use (not just graphics) the operating system has heavy hardware checking (just like MacOS) and unfortunately may have some anti-virtual machine source code.

Some changes in the interface are noted, such as the Apple logo being replaced with the Red Star, along with other Communist tweaks that are common for the Red Star OS operating system.

<!-- Best typo ever (in my career so far)

The system is again in Korean, but modifications exist to change the language to Korean.

Normally, the typo makes me regret, but this one was funny !-->

The system is again in Korean, but modifications exist to change the language to English and other languages.

</details>

By default, the user does not have root or sudo privileges, but they can be gained through a program known as `RootSetting` although even with Root privileges, some settings and files cannot be modified.

The system intensively checks to make sure certain files are not modified, and it checks files that go into it.

No further information is currently known.

Sogwang Office is the default Office Software in Red Star OS. It appeared in Red Star OS 3, but may have been there in older versions. Sogwang office is a heavily modified version of OpenOffice, and is named after the Sogwansa Buddhist Temple in Kosan Country, Kangwon Province, in North Korea. This temple was destroyed by United States bombing during the Korean War in 1951, and is a prominent site to North Korea, which intends to rebuild it, but doesn't appear to have made any progress in the past 71 years.

##### Emojis

###### North Korean Flag Emoji

The North Korean flag emoji was added with Emoji 1.0 in 2015. It has the flag code of `KP` and renders as `🇰🇵`

##### Internet

Internet is highly restricted to the population of North Korea.

###### KP Top Level Domain

`.kp` is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for North Korea; it was created on 24 September 2007.

North Korea applied for the .kp Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) in 2004. ICANN, however, refused because North Korea did not meet some of the requirements. Another attempt was made via Korea Computer Center (KCC) Europe in 2006. Later, the main body of KCC and the North Korean Ambassador to the United Nations petitioned ICANN again. They were refused again for providing insufficient information. A new application was sent in January 2007 and an ICANN delegation visited the country in May. This time ICANN agreed to assign .kp to North Korea.

One of the first organizations to adopt a .kp domain was the Korean Central News Agency in 2009. Previously, the .kp domain was managed by Korea Computer Center (KCC) Europe. A large number of .kp websites were also hosted by KCC Europe in Germany. However, in 2011, management was transferred to the Pyongyang-based Star Joint Venture.

###### 2006 Nuclear activity

On 2006, October 9th, North Korea performed its first successful nuclear bomb test, which had a yield of 0.2 to 1 kilotons. They disabled their nuclear reactor in 2007 due to immense international pressure, but this was short lived.

###### 2007 Nuclear activity

No nuclear activity for North Korea was reported in 2007.

###### 2008 Nuclear activity

No nuclear activity for North Korea was reported in 2008.

###### 2009 Nuclear activity

On 2009, April 25th, North Korea publicly announced that it had re-activated its nuclear facilities, and exactly 1 month later, North Korea detonated their second nuclear bomb, underground. It had a yield of 2 to 7 kilotons.

###### 2010 Nuclear activity

In May of 2010, North Korea claimed it had successfully performed nuclear fusion.

###### 2011 Nuclear activity

No nuclear activity for North Korea was reported in 2011.

###### 2012 Nuclear activity

No nuclear activity for North Korea was reported in 2012.

###### 2013 Nuclear activity

On 2013, February 12th, at 2:57 GMT, monitors in Asia picked up unusual seismic activity from North Korea, and the country later reported that they had detonated another nuclear bomb. Reports of the yield are mixed, South Korea says the yield was 7.7 to 7.8 kilotons, while other researchers claim the yield was 12.2 ± 3.8 kilotons.

###### 2014 Nuclear activity

No nuclear activity for North Korea was reported in 2014.

###### 2015 Nuclear activity

In 2015, December, Kim Jong Un claimed that the country was capable of launching a hydrogen bomb.

###### 2016 Nuclear activity

On 2016, January 6th, after reported earthquakes in Asia, North Korea claimed it had detonated its first hydrogen bomb successfully, although whether the bomb was a hydrogen bomb is disputed.

###### 2017 Nuclear activity

On 2017, February 18th, China suspended coal imports to North Korea.

On 2017, March 6th, North Korea launched a nuclear missile into the sea of Japan.

On 2017, April 16, hours after the military parade in Pyongyang, North Korea attempted to launch a ballistic missile from a site near the port of Sinpo, on the country's east coast. The missile exploded seconds after launch. 

On 2017, April 28, North Korea launched an unidentified ballistic missile over Pukchang airfield, in North Korean territory. It blew up shortly after take-off at an altitude of approximately 70 km (44 mi).

On 2017, July 4, North Korea launched Hwasong-14 from Banghyon airfield, near Kusong, in a lofted trajectory it claims lasted 39 minutes for 930 km (578 mi), landing in the waters of the Japanese exclusive economic zone. US Pacific Command said the missile was aloft for 37 minutes, meaning that in a standard trajectory it could have reached all of Alaska, a distance of 6,690 km (4,160 mi). By targeting the deep waters in the Sea of Japan, North Korea was ensuring that American or Japanese divers would encounter difficulties when attempting to recover Hwasong-14's engine. Equally, North Korea was not attempting to recover any re-entry debris either, which South Korea pointed out is an indication that this first launch was of an ICBM which was far from ready for combat. As of July 2017, the U.S. estimated that North Korea would have a reliable nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) by early 2018. On July 28, North Korea launched a second, apparently more advanced, ICBM, with altitude around 3,700 km (2,300 mi), that traveled 1,000 km (620 mi) down range; analysts estimated that it was capable of reaching the continental United States.

On 2017, September 3, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a thermonuclear bomb, also known as a hydrogen bomb. Corresponding seismic activity similar to an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 was reported by the USGS, making the blast around 10 times more powerful than previous detonations by the country. Later the bomb yield was estimated to be 250 kilotons, based on further study of the seismic data. The test was reported to be "a perfect success" by North Korean authorities.

On 2017, November 28, North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile in the first such launch from the country in more than two months. The missile, believed by the U.S. Military to be an ICBM, was launched from Sain Ni and flew roughly 1,000 km (620 mi) before landing in the Sea of Japan.

After North Korea claimed that the missile was capable of "carrying [a] super-heavy [nuclear] warhead and hitting the whole mainland of the U.S.", Kim-Jong-Un announced that they had "finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force", putting them in a position of strength to push the United States into talks.

###### 2018 Nuclear activity

No nuclear activity for North Korea was reported in 2018.

###### 2019 Nuclear activity

In August 2019 Japan has upgraded its estimate of North Korea's nuclear weapons capability in an upcoming annual Defence White Paper, saying it seems Pyongyang has achieved the miniaturization of warheads. The defence report will maintain Japan's contention that North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs pose a "serious and imminent threat" to its security after recent meetings between Donald Trump and the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, failed to make progress on denuclearisation

###### 2020 Nuclear activity

Bruce Klingner of the American Heritage Foundation estimated, in June 2020, that North Korea has likely built "eight or more additional nuclear weapons" since the 2018 summit.

On October 10, 2020, North Korea unveiled a massive ICBM during a military parade for the 75th anniversary of the Workers' Party of Korea, with CNN reporting that military analysts believe it is one of the world's largest road-mobile ballistic missiles.

###### 2021 Nuclear activity

No nuclear activity for North Korea was reported in 2021.

[From Wikipedia: Flag of North Korea oldid=1080399013](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_of_North_Korea&oldid=1080399013)

The flag of North Korea, also known as the Ramhongsaek Konghwagukgi (Korean: 람홍색공화국기; literally "blue and red-coloured flag of the republic"), sometimes known as the flag of Korea, consists of a central red panel, bordered both above and below by a narrow white stripe and a broad blue stripe. The central red panel bears a five-pointed red star within a white circle near the hoist. The flag is banned from public use in South Korea under the National Security Act due to its association with the ruling North Korean regime, although some exceptions for the usage of the flag exist.

The North Korean national flag is officially defined in article 170 of Chapter VII of the North Korean constitution. According to it:

"The national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea consists of a central red panel, bordered both above and below by a narrow white stripe and a broad blue stripe. The central red panel bears a five-pointed red star within a white circle near the hoist. The ratio of the width to the length is 1:2."

Color scheme

The video colors approximation is listed below:

**The vertical display.**

The North Korean flag's prominent motif is a red star, which is a universal symbol of communism and socialism, although since the flag's adoption the application of the Marxist-Leninist-natured philosophy of Juche has replaced communist authority as the state's guiding ideology, and references to communism have been systematically removed from the country's constitution and legal documents. However, the constitution is still stated to be socialist in nature. Despite the many changes to the constitution, the description of the flag has always remained the same.

The website of the Korean Friendship Association indicates that, on the contrary, the red star represents revolutionary traditions and the red panel is indicative of the patriotism and determination of the Korean people. The white stripes symbolize the unity of the Korean nation and its culture. The blue stripes represent the desire to fight for independence, peace, friendship, and international unity.

According to a typical North Korean official text published in Rodong Sinmun, Kim Il-sung gave the following significance to the flag's elements:

The red of the flag symbolises anti-Japanese sentiment, and is the colour of blood shed by the Korean patriots and the invincible might of our people firmly united to support the Republic. The white symbolizes one bloodline, one land, one language, one culture of our monoethnic country, which lived in purity. And blue stands for the gallant visage of our people and symbolises the spirit of the Korean people fighting for world peace and progress.

The colours of the North Korean flag – red, white, and blue – are considered national colours and symbolise respectively: revolutionary traditions; purity, strength, and dignity; and sovereignty, peace, and friendship.

[From Wikipedia: Emblem of North Korea oldid=1065706419](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emblem_of_North_Korea&oldid=1065706419)

The National Emblem of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the coat of arms of North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The current version adopted in 1993 is based on a design that was used since the foundation of the republic in 1948. Two previous versions were briefly in use in the late 1940s. Prominent features on the emblem are a red star, a hydroelectric plant (the Sup'ung dam) and Mount Paektu. The design bears similarities to the emblem of the Soviet Union and other emblems of the socialist heraldic style.

It is viewed by the official North Korean line as an embodiment of Kim Il-sung's wisdom, an expression of his leadership, and an idea which provides "a complete answer to any question that arises in the struggle for national liberation".

Juche was pronounced in December 1955 in a speech called On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work in order to emphasize a Korea-centered revolution. Its core tenets are economic self-sufficiency, military self-reliance and an independent foreign policy.

"No Motherland Without You" (or "Ode to Kim Jong Il"), is a North Korean song about the country's Eternal Leader, Kim Jong Il. Composed by Hwang Jin Yong and written by Ri Jong O, it extols the proclaimed talent and virtues of Kim, and the attachment of the North Korean people for him as he led them out of the turmoils of the 1990s famine (referred to as the Arduous March).

The repeated phrase in the song is "We cannot live without you! Our country cannot exist without you!" It is also considered to be the anthem of the Songun ("military-first") policy that Kim implemented in coexistence with the Juche Idea in 1995. It is frequently broadcast on the radio and from loudspeakers on the streets of Pyongyang.

###### No Motherland without you (Lyrics)

| Korean (North) | English (US) |
|-----|------|
| 1.  사나운 폭풍도 쳐몰아 내고 신념을 안겨준 김정일동지 ( 후렴) 당신이 없으면 우리도 없고 당신이 없으면 조국도 없다 | 1. You pushed away the severe storm You made us believe, Comrade Kim Jong Il (Refrain) We cannot live without you Our country cannot exist without you! |

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
